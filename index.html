Every day without you is like a piece of my soul is left somewhere with you, and I feel that emptiness with every breath I take. I miss the sound of your voice, the way you make even the ordinary moments feel magical, and the simple comfort of having you beside me. You‚Äôve become such a vital part of my world that being apart feels almost unnatural. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs this beautiful space in my life that only you can fill, and when you're not here, it feels like there's a quiet ache I carry with me. But even through that longing, my love for you grows stronger with each passing moment. Every thought, every memory, and every dream I have is touched by you, and I am so incredibly grateful for the love we share. I love you more deeply than words can ever express, and I can‚Äôt wait to hold you in my arms again, to feel your warmth and your heartbeat close to mine. Until that moment comes, just know that you are always in my heart, and I am counting down the days until I can be with you again.</p>
